## What is Astro?

### Documentation → [https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/)

Astro is an all-in-one web framework for building fast, content-focused websites.

### What is an Astro Island?

Astro Islands (aka Component Islands) are a pattern of web architecture pioneered by Astro. 
The term “Astro Island” refers to an interactive UI component on an otherwise static page of HTML. Multiple islands can exist on a page, and an island always renders in isolation. Think of them as islands in a sea of static, non-interactive HTML.
